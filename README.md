### Getting up and running

Git clone the contents to a folder `git clone https://github.com/openlawnz/openlawnz.github.io.git`

To begin developing serve that folder with a http server utility such as `http-server` installable by `npm install -g http-server`. After this you can run the command `http-server ./` in the directory to serve the entire directory to view the website.
