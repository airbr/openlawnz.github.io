# OpenLaw Developers Portal

#### Description

This project is a developer portal for all our volunteers to be able to access our projects. We are proud to have a supportive and inclusive community. 

### Installation

1. Git clone the contents to a folder `git clone https://github.com/openlawnz/openlawnz.github.io.git`

2. To begin developing serve that folder with a http server utility such as `http-server` installable by `npm install -g http-server`. After this you can run the command `http-server ./` in the directory to serve the entire directory to view the website.
